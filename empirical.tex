\section{Empirical Analysis}
%
In what follows we discuss empirical results from the three-tanks
running example (see
figure~\ref{fig:three_tanks}). Figure~\ref{fig:fault_injection} shows
the results from one test case: a failure injection (valve $R_1$ stuck
at $50$\%) at $t = 250$. For this simulation we use the highly
accurate non-linear model. The results from this simulation show that
at the time of the fault injection, the water level in tank $T_1$
starts increasing while the water level at tanks $T_2$ and $T_3$ start
decreasing due to the lower inflow.

\end{figure}

%
Next we use the simulation output shown in figure~\ref{fig:three_tanks} to
create a test case for algorithm~\ref{alg:compose_model}. The result
of performing diagnosis with the same non-linear model (that was used in
simulation) are shown in figure~\ref{fig:diagnosis1}. We can see that
the diagnostic accuracy is high (the number of classification errors
at $t = 432$~[s] is only $M_{\mathrm{err}} = 0.034$). The isolation
accuracy is also very high ($M_{\mathrm{iso}} = 7$~[s]).

  \label{fig:diagnosis1}
\end{figure}
\par
%
Figure~\ref{fig:diagnosis_linear_model} shows the diagnostic accuracy
and isolation time with an all-linear model. This all-linear model
delivers both poor diagnostic accuracy (classification errors) and poor
isolation time. After the fault injection at $t = 250$~[s] the
probability estimation is better and the fault valve appears
at the top of the list of faulty components. The benefit of the
all-linear model is that it is much faster to simulate.

  \label{fig:diagnosis_linear_model}
\end{figure}
\par
%
The plot in figure~\ref{fig:diagnosis_t2_t3_linear} shows the
diagnostic performance with partly linear, partly non-linear model
($T_1$ is non-linear, while $T_2$ and $T_3$ are linear). The
diagnostic accuracy is almost the same, except a false-positive
detection at the beginning of the scenario that can be ignored. Of
course, the number of computations for simulating the partly linear
model is significantly smaller (recall that we need multiple
simulations for diagnosis). As a result this model is a preferred
compromise for diagnostic accuracy and computational complexity.

\end{figure}
\par
%
Algorithm~\ref{alg:compose_model} is insensitive to the cardinality of
the fault injection. Figure~\ref{fig:double_fault_injection}, for
example, shows the result of a double-fault injection. The first fault
represents a $50$~\%-stuck valve $R_1$ at $t = 250$ and the second
fault represents a stuck-valve $R_2$ at $75$~\% at $t = 250$. Clearly,
the effect of the second fault is less pronounced due to its
magnitude.

\end{figure}
\par
Figure~\ref{fig:diagnosis_double} shows the fault-probability for the
double-fault injection shown in
figure~\ref{fig:double_fault_injection} with a fully non-linear
model. For this, we have configured the diagnostic reasoner to
consider double-fault hypotheses (see \cite{feldman13genius}). Both
faults are captured with short isolation time.
Classification error is $M_{\mathrm{err}} = 0$ and
$M_{\mathrm{iso}} = 9$ while for the second (cumulative) fault we have
$M_{\mathrm{err}} = 0.445$ and $M_{\mathrm{iso}} = 31$.

  \caption{Probability of finding the double-fault with all components non-linear}
  \label{fig:diagnosis_double}
\end{figure}
\par
Figure~\ref{fig:diagnosis_double_t2_t3_linear} shows the diagnostic
performance of the model computed by
algorithm~\ref{alg:compose_model}. In this model tank equations for
$T_1$ are non-linear while tank equations for $T_2$ and $T_3$ are
linear. The diagnostic performance is the same as with the fully
non-linear model.

\end{figure}
\par
%
Again, the partly-linear model, whose performance is shown in
figure~\ref{fig:diagnosis_double_t2_t3_linear}, is the best
compromise in terms of diagnostic accuracy and computational
efficiency.
\par
The results from our experiments are non-intuitive in a sense that
if we replace a non-linear component model with a linear one it does
not affect the diagnostic accuracy while it does improve other
metrics. This cannot be done mechanically for all components as the
diagnostic accuracy may deteriorate suddenly. Our results indicate
that the role of the topology for diagnostic reasoning is important.
