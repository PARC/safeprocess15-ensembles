=======================

A paper on using different component models (for example, qualitative, linear, and non-linear) for achieving better diangostics metrics. There is a strong application case when there is, for example, some Programmable-Logic Controller driving a hydraulic or pneumatic system. It would be very bad for diagnosis if all digital logic was simulated by using its analogue electrical model.
