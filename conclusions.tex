\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}
%
Despite successful applications within the machine learning community~\citep{brown2010ensemble,dietterich2000ensemble},
model ensembles but have not been adopted in diagnostics inference in the past. This paper addresses that gap by proposing
an algorithm learns the optimal system model from a set of component model library given a test set of diagnostic scenarios.

We have shown the proposed algorithm on a dynamic system consisting of three tanks connected with valves. Obtained results
indicate that the model composition may be non-intuitive and give evidence that the choice of modeling abstraction depends
to a large extent on the model topology and cannot be preconceived during the design of the component library.

Future work includes a thorough validation of the proposed algorithm using different topologies, modeling abstraction
libraries, and for different fault scenarios. We are also interested in investigating the impact of the larning phase
in the detection phase of the algorithm.
