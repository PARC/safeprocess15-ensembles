\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}
%
Despite successful applications within the machine learning community~\citep{brown2010ensemble,dietterich2000ensemble},
model ensembles have not been adopted in diagnostics inference. This paper addresses that gap by proposing
an algorithm that, given a test set of diagnostic scenarios, learns the optimal system model from a library of component
models.

We have shown the proposed algorithm on a dynamic system consisting of three tanks connected with valves. Results
indicate that the model composition may be non-intuitive and suggest that the choice of modeling abstraction depends
on the model topology and cannot be preconceived during the design of the component library.

Future work includes a thorough validation of the proposed algorithm using different topologies, modeling abstraction
libraries, and different fault scenarios. We are also interested in investigating the impact of the learning phase
in the detection phase of the algorithm.
